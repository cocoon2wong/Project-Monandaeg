# Resonance Weights

This branch (https://github.com/cocoon2wong/Project-Monandaeg/tree/Re) includes several of our pre-trained SocialCircle models' weights.
You can download all these weights by clicking the green button `<> Code` above, and choose [`Download Zip`](https://github.com/cocoon2wong/Project-Monandaeg/archive/refs/heads/Re.zip).

## Usage

Clone the Re Repo (TBA)

```bash
cd Re
```

Unzip weights files into any positions, then you can test one model (`resdd` as an example) like

```bash
python main.py -l ${PATH_TO_WEIGHTS}/Project-Monandaeg-Re/resdd
```

## Note

This is a pretty large repository, so please use `git clone` or `git pull` with caution.
